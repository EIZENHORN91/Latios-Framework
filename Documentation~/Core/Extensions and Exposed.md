# Extensions and Exposed

Sometimes the Unity API is lacking for who knows why. As such, this page lists
all the APIs I have added either by extension methods or using asmrefs to access
the internals.

## Exposed by asmref

The following APIs were created using asmref files and the code is compiled as
part of the package code. Only APIs considered relatively safe for user use are
listed here.

### Unity.Mathematics

-   `math.select()` functions for bool types

### Unity.Entities

-   `World.ExecutingSystemType()` – Returns the currently executing system for
    the given world. This should not be used for gameplay, but may be useful for
    profiling.
-   `World.ExecutingSystemHandle()` – Returns the `SystemHandleUntyped` of the
    executing system for the given world.
-   `World.AsManagedSystem()` – Resolves a `SystemHandleUntyped` into a
    `ComponentSystemBase` or `null`.
-   `WorldUnmanaged.GetAllSystemStates()` – Returns an array of all
    `SystemState` instances stored in the world. The `SystemState` instances can
    be fetched by ref from the array object.
-   `WorldExposedExtensions.GetMetaIdForType()` – Computes the meta ID for a
    system type so that an unmanaged type with a resolved `SystemState` can be
    compared against the meta ID.
-   `ComponentSystemGroup.GetSystemGroupEnumerator()` – Returns an enumerator
    which can traverse both managed and unmanaged systems in order.
-   `SystemSortingTracker` – Struct type which can detect added or removed
    systems and resort the system groups.
-   `EntityManager.CopySharedComponent()` – Copies the value of a shared
    component from one entity to another given only the `ComponentType`. Will
    add the `ComponentType` to the destination entity if absent.
-   `BlobAssetReference<T>.GetLength()` – Returns the number of bytes associated
    with the blob asset starting from `GetUnsafePtr()`

## Extensions

The following methods did not require internal access to implement and act as
extension methods to Unity’s types.

### Unity.Entities

-   `BlobBuilder.ConstructFromNativeArray<T>(ref BlobArray<T>, NativeArray<T>)`
    – A convenience method for initializing a `BlobArray` from a `NativeArray`.
-   `BlobBuilder.AllocateFixedString<T>(ref BlobString, T)` – Allocates a
    `BlobString` from a `FixedString` or `HeapString`, allowing `BlobStrings` to
    be constructed in Burst.
-   `NativeList<T>.AddRangeFromBlob(ref BlobArray<T>)` – Copies the `BlobArray`
    data to the `NativeList`.
-   `EntityManager.CopyComponentData(Entity src, Entity dst, ComponentType)` –
    Copies an unmanaged `IComponentData` from one entity to the other. Will add
    the `ComponentType` to the destination entity if absent.
-   `EntityManager.CopyDynamicBuffer(Entity src, Entity dst, ComponentType)` –
    Copies a `DynamicBuffer` from one entity to the other. Will add the
    `ComponentType` to the destination entity if absent.

### Unity.Collections

-   `StringBuilder.Append(FixedString)` – Appends a `FixedString` to the
    StringBuilder
